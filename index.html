		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p> 
		Hi I'm Osbourne. I have a joy of coding, problem solving and a general 
		itch to try anything. I mainly work with the c language family but have 
		also delved into other languages such as python, and JavaScript. My main 
		interest is backend system development, this includes things such as: 
		using the IP (internet protocols), the mechanisms that are applied to the
		front end like APIs and controllers in MVC, and general architecture 
		design where interactivity is thought out and how each section should work. 
		</p> 
		<p> 
		As for my recent endeavours. I have worked alongside a client, in a team,
		to develop a mod through their custom-made modding API. While designing 
		and creating levels I began thinking up a level editor that would help 
		with the creation life cycle, and as a result I later created a Level 
		editing tool that makes YAML files easier to visualise as well as 
		manipulate.  
		</p> 
		<p> 
		As well as clientele and 3d game-based development I have also designed
		and created a web server from the ground up using the http/1.1 
		specification. The webserver had the ability to serve everything needed
		for a web page to work: html, CSS, JavaScript, PNG, jpg, jpeg. 
		</p> 
		<p> 
		I plan for acquiring a job in embedded development, primarily in 
		embedded software side but also wouldn't mind the other sides such as 
		PCB board development, and potentially circuit design though I would 
		need to study some more for circuit development. Other fields also 
		interest me and so as a backup plan i can go into games development as 
		I've also got skills (and a BSc) In games development. 
		</p>
